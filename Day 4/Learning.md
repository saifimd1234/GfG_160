`1 % 5` will be **`1`** âœ…

---

### Why?

The modulus operator `%` gives the **remainder** after division.

```
1 Ã· 5 = 0 remainder 1
```

So, if dividend is less than divisor then the dividend itself is returned.

```python
1 % 5  # 1
```

---

ðŸ“Œ **Extra examples:**

```python
0 % 5  # 0  (0 divided by 5 leaves remainder 0)
4 % 5  # 4  (4 divided by 5 leaves remainder 4)
5 % 5  # 0  (5 divided by 5 leaves remainder 0)
6 % 5  # 1  (6 divided by 5 leaves remainder 1)
```

---

When **`d > n`**, rotating more than the array length just repeats the same positions.
We handle that by doing:

```python
d = d % n
```

This gives the **effective rotation** count.

---

### **Final Efficient Solution (Handles `d > n`)**

```python
class Solution:
    def rotateArr(self, arr, d):
        n = len(arr)
        d = d % n  # Effective rotation
        arr[:] = arr[d:] + arr[:d]  # In-place rotation
```

---

**Example Runs:**

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Solution().rotateArr(arr, 7)  
# d=7 â†’ 7 % 5 = 2 â†’ Output: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
Solution().rotateArr(arr, 8)  
# d=8 â†’ 8 % 4 = 0 â†’ Output: [10, 20, 30, 40] (no rotation)
```

---

Yes â€” exactly ðŸ™‚
When `d > n`, the rotation doesnâ€™t stop â€” it just keeps going and ends up at the same position youâ€™d get by doing `d % n` rotations.

Think of it like a clock: rotating 14 hours forward is the same as rotating 2 hours forward, because `14 % 12 = 2`.

---

### Why `d % n` Works

Letâ€™s say:

```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 5
```

If `d = 7`:

1. Rotate 1 step â†’ `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
2. Rotate 2 steps â†’ `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`
3. ...
4. Rotate 5 steps â†’ back to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
5. Rotate 7 steps â†’ same as rotating 2 steps (`7 % 5 = 2`)

---

### **Optimized In-Place Rotation (Handles d > n)**

```python
class Solution:
    def rotateArr(self, arr, d):
        n = len(arr)
        d = d % n  # Effective rotation steps
        
        # Reverse first d elements
        self.reverse(arr, 0, d - 1)
        # Reverse the remaining elements
        self.reverse(arr, d, n - 1)
        # Reverse the whole array
        self.reverse(arr, 0, n - 1)
    
    def reverse(self, arr, left, right):
        while left < right:
            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
```

---

**Example Run:**

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Solution().rotateArr(arr, 7)  
print(arr)  # [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
```
