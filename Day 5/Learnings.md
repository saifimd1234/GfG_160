Got it — here’s the **standard algorithm** for generating the next permutation in-place.
This is the same one used in competitive programming and interview questions.

### **Python Code**

```python
def next_permutation(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # 1️⃣ Step 1: Find the first index 'i' from the end where nums[i] < nums[i+1]
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0 and nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    
    # 2️⃣ Step 2: If such index exists, find the first index 'j' from the end where nums[j] > nums[i]
    if i >= 0:
        j = n - 1
        while nums[j] <= nums[i]:
            j -= 1
        # Swap nums[i] and nums[j]
        nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
    
    # 3️⃣ Step 3: Reverse the subarray nums[i+1:]
    nums[i + 1:] = reversed(nums[i + 1:])


# Example usage:
arr = [1, 3, 2]
next_permutation(arr)
print(arr)  # Output: [2, 1, 3]
```

### **How it works**

1. **Find a pivot**:
   From the right, find the first number that is smaller than the one next to it.
   This is the place where change will happen.

2. **Find the next bigger number**:
   From the right, find the number just bigger than the pivot and swap them.

3. **Reverse the tail**:
   The part after the pivot should be reversed to get the smallest possible order after the swap.

---

### **Example**

For `[1, 3, 2]`:

* Step 1: Pivot is at index 0 (`1`) because `1 < 3`
* Step 2: Swap `1` with the smallest bigger number from the right (`2`) → `[2, 3, 1]`
* Step 3: Reverse part after pivot index → `[2, 1, 3]`

Alright, Mohammad — let’s go slower and with **a very visual analogy** so the “next permutation” idea clicks.

---

## **Step 1: Imagine numbers like words in a dictionary**

Think of the array as **digits** in a “word,” and we want the next word in dictionary order.

Example:
If numbers are **1 2 3**
All permutations sorted look like this:

1. **1 2 3**
2. **1 3 2**
3. **2 1 3**
4. **2 3 1**
5. **3 1 2**
6. **3 2 1**

If you’re on step 2 (**1 3 2**),
the **next permutation** is **2 1 3** (the one that comes immediately after in the sorted list).

---

## **Step 2: Understanding the "next bigger arrangement"**

Think of it like:

* You have `n` digits.
* The **next permutation** is the arrangement that is:

  1. **Bigger than the current one**
  2. **As small as possible among the bigger ones**

Example:

* Current: `5 3 4`
* Bigger ones are:
  `5 4 3` → bigger
* But the smallest bigger one is `5 4 3` (since only swap last two).

---

## **Step 3: When there is no bigger arrangement**

If you have **3 2 1**, it’s already the **largest possible order**.
The **next permutation** then is **smallest possible order** = `1 2 3`.

---

## **Step 4: Real-life analogy**

Imagine you are rearranging books on a shelf by height in every possible order, from smallest to largest order (like a dictionary of arrangements).
If you are at one arrangement, “next permutation” means you move to the **very next** arrangement in that list.
